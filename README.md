### What I learned

This challenge was my first contact with the SVG element but it wasn't a problem for me. I didn't learn anything new but I'm glad I was able to finish the greater part of the challenge within my first three trials of it. Shows that I'm getting better.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<svg
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  width="336"
  height="201"
  fill="none"
  viewBox="0 0 336 201"
></svg>
```

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 700px) {
}
@media only screen and (min-width: 701px) {
}
```
